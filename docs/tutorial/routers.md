# Route handling

If we want to build a single-page application, we need to be generate and
respond to URLs. One of the key advantages of the web over other platforms is
the ease of which we can share and bookmark information through the URL.
Because of this, Backbone has a powerful route-handling framework for responding
to URLs as they come in.
