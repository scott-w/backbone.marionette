# Making your applications dance!

Welcome to the getting started guide for Backbone Marionette.

## What will I get from this tutorial?

After reading this tutorial you will be able to write your own Marionette
applications from scratch, from installing and managing dependencies, through to
composing a single-page application managed by the `AppRouter`.

## Where do I start?

If you're familiar with installing packages using `npm` and building apps using
Grunt, Gulp, Brunch, or Browserify, then skip ahead to
[building your first view](./firstview.md). If none of that made sense, then
go to the next section on
[installing Node and building with Browserify](./installing.md).
