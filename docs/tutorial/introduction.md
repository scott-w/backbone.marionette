# Making your applications dance!

Welcome to the getting started guide for Backbone Marionette.

## What is Marionette?

Marionette is an extension to [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org) that focuses
on the View and Controller layers of an MVC (Model, View Controller)
application. Backbone does a very good job of enforcing a structure that ensures
you separate your business logic (models) from your rendering logic (views) and
user interaction (controllers).

Marionette extends the VC aspects to give you simpler rendering options in the
form of multiple types of View e.g. CollectionView, LayoutView that can figure
out how to render a given template and set of data intuitively.

Marionette also gives you more tools for managing larger-scale applications
more easily. Applications, regions, and app routers give you far more control
over your application's structure than is available in Backbone itself.

## What will I get from this tutorial?

After reading this tutorial you will be able to write your own Marionette
applications from scratch, from installing and managing dependencies, through to
composing a single-page application managed by the `AppRouter`.

## What next?

If you're familiar with installing packages using `npm` and building apps using
Grunt, Gulp, Brunch, or Browserify, then skip ahead to
[building your first view](./firstview.md). If none of that made sense, then
go to the next section on
[installing Node and building with Browserify](./installing.md).
