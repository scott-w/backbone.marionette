# Marionette Tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a step-by-step guide to getting
started with Marionette and Backbone. This is a thorough walkthrough that will
take a new Marionette developer from just a browser and a text editor through
to a working Marionette application.

## Aim

A new developer, after completing this tutorial, is able to start building their
own Marionette application from scratch.

### Deprecated Features

This tutorial should not cover any deprecated features - we should actively
remove references to deprecated features in this tutorial. We do not want people
starting from a point where their style must immediately change upon entering
the "real world".

Marking features as deprecated, and recommending upgrade paths, should be
handled elsewhere in the Marionette documentation.
